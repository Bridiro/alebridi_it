        <p>Here are some of my notable projects:</p>
        
        <h2><a href="https://github.com/Bridiro/sw-libfont" target="_blank">sw-libfont</a></h2>
        <p>A lightweight, scalable font rendering library written in pure C. It is designed for embedded systems and microcontrollers, supporting Signed Distance Field (SDF) rendering with efficient RLE compression. The library avoids dynamic memory allocation, making it highly optimized for constrained environments.</p>
        
        <h2><a href="https://github.com/Bridiro/sw-libgraphics" target="_blank">sw-libgraphics</a></h2>
        <p>An abstract graphics library in C, built for performance and portability across different platforms. It provides a simple API for drawing primitives, handling framebuffers, and integrating with hardware accelerators like DMA2D on STM32. It is optimized for real-time applications while maintaining a flexible design.</p>
